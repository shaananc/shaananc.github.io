    <div id="information"><h1>Privacy Policy for Shaanan Cohney's Websites </h1>
    <hr>
    This describes what information my websites collect, what I use the information for, whom I share it with (no one!) and my basis for doing so.

    This policy applies to cohney.info and shaanan.cohney.info (my blog).
    <ul>        
    <li>I use matomo and piwik to collect data. Tools that are known to respect user privacy much better than most analytics.</li>
    <li>I self host the analytics platform so your data is not transmitted to any third parties.</li>
    <li>I also do not and will not share any data acquired this way, unless legally compelled to do so.</li>
    <li> My blog uses Jetpack, part of Wordpress, which collects a small amount of data too that I never see in raw form.</li>        
    <li>I respect do-not-track cookies.</li>
    </ul>

	<div id="what">
        
        <h2>What do I collect?</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Your IP address with the last two bytes randomized. </li>
        <li>A unique and random user ID stored in a cookie</li>
        <li>Date and time of requests to my sites</li>
        <li>Which page you viewed, and where you came from</li>
        <li>Your screen size (so I know if I have more mobile or desktop visitors)</li>
        <li>The time you visited</li>
        <li>If you downloaded anything, and if so, what</li>
        <li>Any links you clicked</li>
        <li>How long it took for the page to load for you</li>
        <li>The language your computer is set to use</li>
        <li>The User-Agent that identifies what type of browser you were using   </li>
	<li>Any details you enter into a comment</li>
	<li>Wordpress IDs and usernames if you logged in, get sent to wordpress</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="wy">
            <h2>Why do I collect these pieces of information:</h2>

            I use the analytics to get an idea of who is using my website and where they are coming from.
            The main reasons I want this information are:
            <ul>
                <li>To know if I'm doing a good job with writing my blog posts.</li>
                <li>To get an idea of how much effort it's worth putting into making things mobile centric.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="sharing">
      <h2>With whom do I share your data?</h2>
      No one! Except for the data collected by Wordpress Jetpack which is sent to wordpress.com.
    </div>

    <div id="rights">

            <h2>Rights! (These are important)</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>To ask for any of your data that I have and can link to you (shouldn't be anything!). You can ask for it in machine readable form. </li>
                <li>To correct any such information that I have on you.</li>
                <li>To ask me not to collect on you.</li>
                <li> To ask me to erase anything I have that I can link to you.</li>
            </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="retention">


<h2>Retention:</h2>

I keep statistics indefinitely (like how many visitors came to my page overall).
Wordpress keeps the data sent to it for 28 days and is used only to give me aggregate stats on the blog.
